//Inheritance is a mechanism wherein a new class is derived from an existing class;	
//A class derived from another class is called a subclass, whereas the class from which a subclass is derived is called a superclass;
// A subclass can have only one superclass, whereas a superclass may have one or more subclasses;
//Encapsulation is data hiding(information hiding) while Abstraction is detail hiding(implementation hiding)
//Super we have to write first statement...it doesnt work other way
