	// hiding(implementation hiding)
   //An abstract class is a class that is declared with abstract keyword.
    //An abstract method is a method that is declared without an implementation.
    //An abstract class may or may not have all abstract methods. Some of them can be concrete methods
    //A method defined abstract must always be redefined in the subclass,thus making overriding compulsory OR either make subclass itself abstract.
      //Any class that contains one or more abstract methods must also be declared with abstract keyword.
//       Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also
     //Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables.
